Description: Fixes hard-coded (unthemed) tray icons in Linux
 Hardcode-Tray is a utility (written in Python 3) for modern Linux desktop
 environments that fetches themed icons for tray/panel icons if they are
 hard-coded within an installed application (and thus fail to respect the DE's
 theme settings; usually Qt or Electron applications) and backs up then
 replaces them with the current theme's variants, once. Subsequent updates to
 the applications will naturally overwrite the changes, requiring another
 invocation of Hardcode-Tray to restore the theming.
